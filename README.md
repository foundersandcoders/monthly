# FAC  Monthly

Hi! This is a thing I have wanted to do for ages and now it's time to put it in black and white. It will be a monthly dinner somewhere in London for FAC members and friends of FAC, starting with this month.

___

**Date:**  
Once a month, around the same date. I am currently thinking the Wednesday before LNUG, so second last Wednesday of every month. Time will be around 7/8pm. (Except this month (July) which will be mid-month!)  

**Location:**  
Different place every time hopefully, suggestions are wildly encouraged, with a preference for menus that have good vegetarian/vegan support.  

**Attendees:**  
All are welcome, FAC members and anyone they want to bring along, but will probably be limited to 15 or so people or as many as we can reasonably get a table for! The table(s) will be booked 1/2 weeks beforehand, numbers and attendance will be determined by a doodle.

**Communication:**  
Could use the FAC mailing list for announcemnts of that months location and a reminder of the date, but will probably start another one specifically for it. (likely considering there's 1000+ people on the FAC list.) There will be a simple web page with the location etc when I get round to making it but for now I'll keep all information available in this repo. 

___

Everything above is open to discussion so feel free to open up a github issue in true FAC fashion! Especially would like input on locations or drastic oversights/collisions in scheduling.

Really excited about it by the way, I always really enjoy FAC dinners but they usually only involve people from one or two cohorts so it will be great to start mixing things up and will be a cool way for people to stay in touch or reconnect.
