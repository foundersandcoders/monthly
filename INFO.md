**Date:**  
Once a month, around the same date. Ideally the Wednesday before [LNUG](http://lnug.org/), so second last Wednesday of every month. Time will be around 7/8pm.  

**Location:**  
Different place every time, suggestions are wildly encouraged (use the open GitHub issue), with a preference for menus that have vegetarian/vegan options.  

**Attendees:**  
All are welcome, FAC members and anyone they want to bring along, but will probably be limited to 20 or so people or as many as we can reasonably get a table for! The table(s) will be booked around 1 week beforehand, numbers and attendance will be determined by a [Doodle](http://doodle.com/).

**Communication:**  
The FAC Alumni MailChimp list and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/foundersandcoders/).

Everything above is open to discussion so feel free to open up a GitHub issue in true FAC fashion! Especially would like input on locations or drastic oversights/collisions in scheduling.

Really excited about it by the way, I always really enjoy FAC dinners but they usually only involve people from one or two cohorts so it will be great to start mixing things up and will be a cool way for people to stay in touch or reconnect.
